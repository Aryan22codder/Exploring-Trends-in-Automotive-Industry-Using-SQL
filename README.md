# Exploring-Trends-in-Automotive-Industry-Using-SQL
This project explores the trends in the automotive industry by analyzing a dataset containing information about car models, manufacturers, fuel types, mileage, engine capacity, and pricing. The project aims to uncover insights related to fuel efficiency, popular brands, price trends, and performance metrics using SQL queries.
 Project Objective:
To analyze patterns in the automotive industry using structured SQL queries. This includes analyzing mileage, pricing, ownership, transmission types, and model-wise trends across years.
 Key SQL Queries and Purpose:
1)Average Selling Price by Fuel Type (Manual & First Owner):
Analyzed pricing trends for first-owner manual cars to understand resale values across different fuel types.

2)Top 3 Car Models with Highest Average Mileage (More than 5 seats):
Identified efficient large-size vehicles based on mileage data.

3)Models with Price Spread > â‚¹10,000:
Filtered cars showing high variability in pricing, useful for assessing pricing unpredictability.

4)Cars Above Avg Price but Below Avg Mileage:
Highlighted potentially overpriced vehicles with low efficiency.

5)Cumulative Selling Price by Year per Model:
Observed how the value of a model has accumulated over time.

6)Cars Within 10% of Avg Selling Price:
Showed budget-friendly options that hover near average market prices.

7)Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Selling Price (Smoothing Factor = 0.2):
Applied EMA logic to track smoother pricing trends for each model.

8)Models with Price Drop Compared to Previous Year:
Detected declining value cars useful for market depreciation studies.

9)Car with Highest Mileage per Transmission Type:
Compared total kilometers driven to highlight durable models by transmission.

10)Avg Selling Price per Year for Top 3 Selling Models:
Drilled into historical pricing of top-selling models for pricing evolution.
